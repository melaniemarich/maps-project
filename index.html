    <!--INTRO-->
    <p>
      An e-bike crash in Brooklyn on December 8 resulted in the death of standup comic Kenny DeForest, marking New York City's 28th cyclist death in 2023. DeForest’s death makes 2023 the second-deadliest year on record in New York City behind 1999, when 40 cyclists died. It is also the deadliest year since the onset of Vision Zero, a traffic safety initiative set forth by then Mayor Bill de Blasio in 2014 to eliminate traffic deaths and serious injuries.
    </p>

    <p>
      According to Transportation Alternatives, a non-profit advocating against cars and for pedestrians, serious injury crashes are 15% higher in the 10 districts with the highest percentage of residents of color, compared to the citywide average.

    “Traffic violence is a choice,” said Danny Harris, executive director of Transportation Alternatives.</p>

    <p>
        “We cannot continue to accept death on our streets. With just weeks left in 2023, Mayor Adams is on track to miss the legal mandates of the NYC Streets Plan for the second year in a row. This is unacceptable. No more excuses, no more delays. Deliver safe streets today for all New Yorkers.”
